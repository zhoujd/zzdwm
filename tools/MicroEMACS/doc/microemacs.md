# Introduction

This document describes MicroEMACS, a
public-domain[^1] display editor, loosely based on EMACS, that runs on little
computers.
It is intended as a reference manual
for users already familiar with EMACS.

[^1]: The source is now copylefted with the GPL.

We call it Micro *EMACS* to emphasize the fact that
most of the commands are very similar to, if not identical to,
fundamental mode EMACS\index{EMACS} commands (actually, it implements a set of
rebindings used by a group of users at Digital Equipment
Corporation[^2]).

[^2]: Further modified at DRI to more closely resemble, but not
completely emulate, MINCE.\index{MINCE}.

We call it *Micro* EMACS to emphasize the fact that it is
but a shadow of full EMACS. No attempt has been made to make MicroEMACS
wildly
customizable (without writing code), or to have extensive online documentation.
All of this sophistication was thrown away right at the start, because
it was important that MicroEMACS run on little computers.
In all fairness, is should be stated here and now that the most popular
small computer these days is the MicroVAX[^3]!

[^3]: This appears to be a reference by Conroy to DEC's \index{DEC} attempt to ignore the IBM PC.

## History

MicroEMACS is loosely based on the EMACS display editor written by
Richard Stallman at MIT.  The MicroEMACS described by this document is
Conroy's version 30 of February 1986, distributed to USENET
mod.sources.  Since then it has undergone a fair number of bug fixes
and performance improvements, and a few minor enhancements.

This version of MicroEMACS is not to be confused with other popular
versions that are derived from Conroy's November 1985 release.  These
other versions of MicroEMACS have version numbers like 3.8 or 3.9, are
considerably larger and feature-rich, are copyrighted, and are now
being maintained by Daniel Lawrence. 

I (Mark Alexander) converted this document from TeX to Scribe to FinalWord
1.15 to Borland Sprint, and finally to Pandoc/Latex, since Sprint
is no longer available and doesn't run on Linux.  I added new material
to bring the document up to date with the program itself.

### 2018 Update

I have lost the original source of Conroy's version of MicroEMACS (including the TeX version
of this document), and I cannot find it on Google's USENET archive.
I have also lost my DOS and OS/2 source
code, though the Windows code (in the `nt` subdirectory) still exists.
This document contains many reference to historical machines and operating
systems, but I have kept them for historical interest.  I maintain
only the Linux\index{Linux} version now.

In the 80s, MicroEMACS was small enough to run easily from a floppy disk, but the amount of text that
could be edited was limited by the very small amount of available RAM
(640kb on PCs running MS-DOS).  Nowadays this limit is effectly non-existent, give the huge amount of memory
found in modern computers, but MicroEMACS is still small enough to be run from a floppy disk
(if one could be found); its code size is about the same as `/bin/ls` on a current 64-bit
Linux distribution.

# Some Basic Concepts

This section describes a number of basic concepts,
which will be used again and again in the following descriptions.
Most of it should be familiar to EMACS users.
New users are advised not to get stuck reading this section,
because most of the information will become clear the first time you
play with the editor on a computer.

## Screen Layout

\index{Screen layout}
MicroEMACS divides the screen into two areas. The very last
line on the screen, which is used to display messages and
ask one line questions, is called the *echo line* \index{Echo line}.
Typing in the echo line
is like typing commands to the operating system.  More details later
in the section [**The Echo Line**](#the-echo-line).

The remainder of the screen is filled with text *windows* \index{Window}.
When MicroEMACS is first started, there will be one or two text windows,
depending on how many files you specify on the invocation line.
If there is only one window, it fills the screen.  If there are two
windows, each occupies half the screen.
Windows can be created, deleted, and adjusted in
size using MicroEMACS commands.

## Mode Lines

The last line of a window (the line, usually in reverse video,
that starts with `MicroEMACS`) is
the *mode line* \index{Mode line} for the window.
It contains information about what is being displayed in the
window. Mode lines separate windows from each other and from the
echo line.

Three important bits of information are displayed in the mode line.
These are the buffer *mode* \index{Mode} (if any) in parentheses,
the *buffer name* \index{Buffer name},
the *file name* \index{File name},
and the *buffer changed flag* \index{Buffer changed flag}.

A window is always displaying a buffer\index{Buffer}.
The name of the buffer being
displayed in the window is shown in the mode line, right after the
`MicroEMACS` and the buffer mode.

A buffer may have a file\index{File} associated with it.
Usually this is the last file read into or written from the
buffer. If a file is associated with the buffer, the name of the
file is displayed in the mode line, prefixed by `File:`.
On operating systems in which file names are case insensitive
(for example, VMS) the file name will always be in lower case.

MicroEMACS knows if a buffer has been changed since it was last
written to its associated file. It informs you of this fact by displaying
a `*` in the mode line immediately to the left of the `MicroEMACS`
string.

## Keyboard Conventions

\index{Keyboard conventions}
Internally, MicroEMACS represents keyboard characters in a special
11 bit code. This code consists of 8 bits of character data (ASCII plus
whatever characters your terminal puts in the right side graphics set), and
3 flags, the *CONTROL* flag\index{CONTROL flag},
the *META* flag\index{META flag},
and the *CTLX* flag\index{CTLX flag}.
Combinations of the three flags are possible, with the exception that
META and CTLX cannot be set at the same time.

This manual represents 11 bit characters in a standard way. If you
have a character `A`, then that character with
the *CONTROL* bit set is
written as **C-A**. That character with the
*META* bit set is written as **M-A**.
That character with the *CTLX* bit set is written as **C-X A**.
If both the META and CONTROL bits are set, it is written as **M-C-A**.
If both the CTLX and CONTROL bits are set, it is written as **C-X C-A**.

Terminals (usually) cannot deal directly deal with the 11 bit
character set.
Characters with the flag bits set are entered by prefixing the
desired character with another character, as follows:

* To get a character with the *CONTROL* bit set,
hold down the `CTRL` key while entering the character.
An alternative method
is to prefix the character with `Control-^` (the
word `Control` here, and in the next few examples, means the key marked
`Control` or `CTRL` on the ASCII keyboard).

* To get a character with the
*META* bit set, prefix the character
with `Control-[`, `Escape`, or `ESC`.  An alternative method that
works on FlexOS is to
hold down the `ALT` key while entering the character.  This method
also works on PC-DOS, but only with `ALT-A` through `ALT-Z`.

* To get a character with the
*CTLX* bit set, prefix the character
with `Control-X`.

* To get a character with the *CONTROL*
and *META* bits set, prefix the character
with `Control-\`.  An alternative method is to prefix the character
with `ESC`\index{ESC key}, then hold down `CTRL` while entering the character.

* Those of you who understand ASCII are probably asking what you get
if you prefix a character with `Control-]`.
This character is not a prefix;
it is reserved for future use as an "exit from recursive editing level"
command.

CONTROL characters\index{CONTROL characters}
are very important, so there is a shorthand way
of typing them, as follows:

* Characters between `Control-@` (`Control-Space` on some keyboards)
and `Control-Z` are mapped
to the characters `@` through `Z` with the *CONTROL* bit set.

* Characters between
`Control-a` and `Control-z` are mapped to
the characters `A` through `Z`
with the *CONTROL* bit set.

This shorthand means that that **M-C-V**, for example, can be entered 
either as
`ESC` followed by `Control-V`, or as `Control-\` followed by `V`.
As another example, **C-X C-B** is entered as `Control-X` followed
by `Control-B`.

### The PC Keyboard

\index{PC-DOS}
MicroEMACS understands all of the cursor keypad and function keys
on PC\index{PC} compatible machines, and the equivalent keys on
other machines that run FlexOS\index{FlexOS} (such as
the VME/10\index{VME/10}).  These keys include the function keys
\index{Function keys}(F1-F10), shifted function keys (S-F1 to S-F10),
cursor keys\index{Cursor keys} (Up, Down, Left,
Right, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End), Delete, and Insert.
These keys may be combined with the ALT and CTRL keys.

On PCs, you can use the `ALT` key
\index{ALT key} as the
META flag, instead of the `ESC` key\index{ESC key}.
For example, the **M-L** command
(lower-word) can be executed in either of two ways:

* Hit `ESC` followed by `L`.

* Hold down `ALT` and hit `L`.

On PC-DOS and Linux, the `ALT` key only works with alphabetic
characters (`A` through `Z`).
Using `ALT` and `CTRL` together is also not supported.

On FlexOS, the `ALT` key works with both alpha and non-alpha
characters, and simultaneously with the `CTRL` key.
Thus, the command **M-C-V** (display-version) can be executed by
holding down `ALT` and `CTRL`, while pressing
`V` (not an easy task, in this writer's opinion).

On the VME/10\index{VME/10}, some of the cursor keys are not available, due to
the inherent physical limitations of the keyboard itself.

See the [**Wall Chart**](#wall-chart) section of this manual for the
predefined bindings of some the special PC\index{PC} keys.

### The Zenith Z-19/29 Keyboard

\index{Zenith Z-19}
\index{Zenith Z-29}
MicroEMACS treats the numeric keypad on the Z-19/29 similarly to the
EDT/VMS\index{EDT}\index{VMS} customizations in common use at DRI.
It does this by putting the terminal in "alternate keypad mode", so that
the keypad produces escape sequences instead of numbers.
The arrow keys (2, 4, 6 and 8) move one line
or one character at a time; when shifted they move by pages or word.
When preceded by the F6 key (BLUE on Z-19), the arrow keys
move to the beginning
or end of the current line or buffer.
The 5 key is the same as **C-S** (forw-search), and shift-5 is
search-again.  See the [**Wall Chart**](#wall-chart) section of this manual
for further key bindings for the Z-19/29.

Not all of the key bindings that allow the shifted arrows to work like EDT
\index{EDT} are
built into MicroEMACS.  This is because they conflict with the traditional
definitions of **M-B** and **M-C**.  Therefore, these rebindings
are placed in a profile\index{Profile} called **edt.pro**\index{EDT.PRO}.
If you want MicroEMACS
to read these bindings when it starts up, and you don't care about
losing the old meanings of **M-B** and **M-C**, then
copy **edt.pro** to the default profile name, as described below
in the [**Profiles**](#profiles) section.

### The VT-100 Keyboard

MicroEMACS understands the arrow keys and the keypad on VT-100\index{VT-100}
style keyboards. Only the PF1 through PF4 keys on the keypad have any
special meaning; the digits,
the `-` key, and the `,` key are treated just
like the non keypad versions of those characters.
The `Enter` key is treated
exactly like the `Return` key.

The arrow keys may be used for moving around. The left arrow is the
same as  **C-B**,
the right arrow is the same as **C-F**, the up arrow is the same
as **C-P**, and the down arrow is the same as **C-N**.

The four function keys are command keys.
The `PF1` key is the same as **M-X**
(the `PF1` key is where the `Gold` key normally
resides on DEC products, so
it is a good choice for the key that asks for extended commands).
The `PF2` key is the same as **C-Q** (quote character).
The `PF3` key is the same as **C-S** (search forward).
The `PF4` key is the same as **C-R** (search reverse). 
These assignments have not been proven optimal, so they may get changed
in the future.

### The LK201 Keyboard

\index{LK-201}
The escape key, used in all *META* commands, is very poorly placed on
the LK201 keyboard. To make typing a bit easier, the grave accent is also
considered to be a *META* prefix on the LK201;
the grave accent is right where you expect the escape key to be located.
A grave accent must be quoted to exter it into the text.

The arrow keys and all of the keys on the keypad
work just like they do on the VT-100\index{VT-100} keyboard.

The keys immediately above the arrow keys try to do what their name
implies. `Next Screen` is the same as **C-V**.
`Prev Screen` is the same as
**M-V**. `Select` is the same as **C-@ ** (set mark).
`Remove` is the same as
**C-W** (kill region). `Insert here`
is the same as **C-Y** (yank from killbuffer).
`Find` is the same as **C-S** (search forward).

The `F6`, `F7`, `F8`,
`F9`, `F10`, and `F14` keys are unused.
The `F11` is escape, which is a *META* prefix key.
The `F12` key is backspace. The `F13` key is linefeed.

The `Help` key is unused. The `Do`
key is the same as **C-X E** (execute keyboard macro).

The `F17` key is the same as **C-X P** (previous window).
The `F18` key is the same as **C-X N** (next window).
The `F19` key is the same as **C-X Z** (grow window).
The `F20` key is the same as **C-X C-Z** (shrink window).

## Key Bindings

\index{Key binding}
Normally when you type a key, MicroEMACS attempts to
interprets the key as a command.  Internally, MicroEMACS keeps a table
of each possible key, and the command assocated
with that key.  This association is called the "key binding."  
Even text keys,
such as the letters, numbers, and punctuation, are "bound" to a command
called "ins-self"\index{ins-self}
that just inserts the key that invoked it into the text.

Not all commands are bound to a particular
key.  These commands can still be entered by using
the (**M-X**) (`ESC X`) "extended-command"\index{Extended command}
prefix, or by binding them to a key
with the "bind-to-key" command.
See the section [**Key Binding Commands**](#key-binding-commands)
below for more information.

In subsequent sections, the command descriptions will give not only the
key that the command is normally bound to, but also the command name,
which is useful when you want to change the key bindings.

## The Echo Line

\index{Echo line}
The echo line has two purposes; displaying messages and asking one
line questions.

Two types of messages\index{Messages} are displayed in the echo line.
Informational messages tell you something useful, but do not imply in any
way that something is wrong. These messages are always enclosed in square
brackets ([ and ]).
Error messages indicate that something has
prevented a command from being executed. They are never enclosed in square
brackets, and will be accompanied by a beep from the terminal's bell if
the sound of the bell is not too obnoxious.

The echo line is cleared by the next keystroke.

The echo line is also used for asking and answering questions.
After the
prompt\index{Prompt}, you can type any characters you like. The reply is always
terminated by a `Return`. Before you commit to the reply, you can edit the reply
using the following characters:

* `Backspace` or `Rubout`: delete the character to the left of the cursor.

* `Control-A`: move the cursor to the beginning of the line.

* `Control-B`: move the cursor one character to the left.

* `Control-D`: delete the character under the cursor.

* `Control-E`: move the cursor to end of the line.

* `Control-F`: move the cursor one character to the right.

* `Control-K`: delete from the cursor to the end of the line.

* `Control-Q`: enter the next character literally into the line (useful for entering control characters).

* `Control-U`: delete the entire line.

You can also abort\index{Abort} the command in progress by typing `Control-G`.
Command processors are designed to ask all questions before doing nasty
things, so that you will never do damage by aborting a command.

The echo line supports autocompletion\index{autocompletion}.  If you are entering
a command name, a filename, or a buffer name, you can use the
`Space` or `Tab` keys to tell MicroEMACS to complete as
much of the entry as possible, based on what you have entered so far.
If you are entering a filename, pressing `Control-S` will fill in
the directory part of the current buffer's filename, making it easier
to find a file in the same directory.
Pressing the `?` or `Control-D` keys will open a new temporary window containing
the possible list of choices.

If you are entering a search string, pressing `Control-S` will fill in
the previous search string.

## Command Arguments

All commands can be given a numeric argument\index{Argument}.
Most commands use this
argument as a repeat count. Commands can tell if an argument has been
supplied, and will use a default argument if no user argument is present.
Usually, the default argument is `1`.

A **C-U** preceding a command always introduces an argument.

If a numeric argument is just a string of **C-U** characters, then the
value of the argument is
4^(number of **C-U** characters), where "^" means "to the power."
Therefore **C-U** is 4, **C-U C-U** is 16,
**C-U C-U C-U** is 256, and so on.
Some commands
care if an argument is present, but don't look at its value; the **C-U**
character is a good way to say "here is an argument".

If there is a signed decimal number after the string of
**C-U** characters it specifies the value of the argument. In this case
the number of **C-U** characters does not matter. An argument of 10 can be
represented by **C-U 10**,
**C-U C-U 10**, or even **C-U C-U C-U C-U 10**.

## Dot, Mark, and the Region

Most editing commands act on the character or characters surrounding
the current location in the current buffer.  The thing that marks the current
location is always called *dot* \index{Dot}.  The dot always points between two
characters.  This isn't the way that the cursor works on most display terminals,
so, by convention, dot is always immediately to the left of the character
on which the hardware cursor is placed.

There is also a second remembered position in the buffer, called the
*mark* \index{Mark}. There are commands that set the value of mark.

Some commands act on a block of text called the *region* \index{Region}.
The region is
all of the characters between dot and mark. The relative positions of dot
and mark do not matter.

# Starting

\index{Starting}

Start editing by typing the command

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
pe [-b] [-d] [-x] [-z] [-p \emph{profile}] \emph{filename1} \emph{filename} ...
\end{Verbatim}

(The name `pe` was chosen to avoid confusion with other versions
of MicroEMACS.  Think of it as an abbreviation of "puny emacs".)

The options -b, -x, -z, and -p are optional.  They have the following
meanings:

-b

:   Tells MicroEMACS to make backups\index{Backup file} of the files you edit.
    It will create a backup file the first time you save a file that has been
    changed.  It makes the backup by renaming the original file
    before it writes out the new version.  If you have defined an
    XBACKUP environment variable, MicroEMACS treats it as a directory
    name and moves the original file into that directory.  If you haven't
    defined XBACKUP, MicroEMACS renames the original file in one of two ways:

    * On UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux,\index{UNIX}, it appends a "~" character to the filename.

    * On PC-DOS\index{PC-DOS} and FlexOS\index{FlexOS},
    it changes the extension to ".BAK".

    This option has no effect on VMS\index{VMS}, because VMS supports multiple
    file versions.

-d

:   Tells MicroEMACS to pass the -d flag to cscope\index{cscope}, which tells it
    to not update its cross-reference file (`cscope.out`).  This is useful when using
    a cross-reference file generated by another program, such as starscope.

-x

:   Tells MicroEMACS to use the XON/XOFF\index{XON/XOFF}
    protocol for starting
    and stopping transmission to your terminal.  This is necessary if
    you are using a DEC terminal, or any terminal that might lose characters
    during lengthy operations, such as multi-line scrolls.
    This option is probably not necessary for Zenith Z-29\index{Zenith Z-29}
    terminals, or if your computer uses a memory-mapped display.
    Unfortunately, this option prevents you from using Control-S\index{Control-S}
    and Control-Q\index{Control-Q} while editing.
    You can get around this problem by
    reassigning the functions that normally are invoked with these
    keys to other keys.  These key assignments could be placed in
    your startup profile\index{Profile} (see the [**Profiles**](#profiles) section below).

-z

:   Tells MicroEMACS to append a
    Control-Z\index{Control-Z} to output files, and to
    treat Control-Z as an end-of-file character when reading text files
    or profiles.  This option is provided for compatibility with older
    editors and language processors.  It has no effect on VMS or UNIX.

-p *profile*

:   Tells MicroEMACS to read the specified
    *profile* \index{profile} at startup,
    instead of the default profile.  See the [**Profiles**](#profiles) section for
    more information about profiles.

-r

:   Tells MicroEMACS to mark all buffers as read-only\index{read-only} by default.  This
    is useful in preventing unwanted changes being made when browsing files.
    A buffer can subsequently be made read-write with the
    **toggle-readonly**\index{toggle-readonly} command.

The filenames\index{File name} *filename1*, *filename2*, etc., are the names
of the files you want to edit.  MicroEMACS
will load the specified files into separate buffers\index{Buffer},
and you can start editing them.

MicroEMACS will create up to two
split-screen windows\index{Window} to view the first two files you specify.
If you specify only one file, MicroEMACS will create one full-screen
window.  The commands for manipulating windows are described in the
[**Window Management**](#window-management) section below.

Any changes you make to a file while it is in a buffer will not affect
the original file until you tell MicroEMACS to save the file.

You can omit the filenames when you start.  MicroEMACS will present you
with an empty buffer called "main", which has no associated filename.
You can give this buffer a filename, or read a file into it,
or you can read files
into their own separate buffers.  The commands for reading and saving files
are described in the [**Files**](#files) section below.

After MicroEMACS reads in the files you specify (if any), but before
it accepts any keyboard entries,
it executes
the commands in the startup profile (either the one you specified
with the -p option, or the default profile).

# Quitting

\index{Quitting}
When you finish editing, you have to quit.
MicroEMACS never writes out a file because it thinks that this
is the right thing to do. However, it will attempt to protect you from
forgetting to do so.


C-X C-C

:   **quit**\index{C-X C-C}\index{Quit}

    This is the basic quit command. MicroEMACS exits, returning
    control to the shell. If there are any changed buffers that have not been
    written out, it will ask for permission to quit. Supplying an argument to
    **C-X C-C** makes the command quit unconditionally, without asking for
    confirmation. The value of the argument is not important.
    On PCs, this function is also bound to `F4`.

C-C

:   **spawn-cli**\index{C-C}\index{spawn-cli}

    This command suspends the execution of MicroEMACS, and runs
    a command interpreter\index{Shell}\index{Command interpreter}
    in a subjob\index{Subjob}.
    When the subjob terminates, the screen
    is cleared and repainted.

    Subjobs are implemented in FlexOS\index{FlexOS},
    PC-DOS\index{PC-DOS}
    VMS\index{VMS}, and UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux\index{UNIX}.
    Users of CP/M\index{CP/M} are out of luck.

    Exit the command interpreter and return to MicroEMACS with one of the following:

    * On VMS enter the **logout** command.

    * If you are using the c-shell\index{c-shell} or bash\index{bash}
    on Unix-like operating systems, enter the **fg** command.

    * On all other systems enter the **exit** command.

C-X C

:   **jeff-exit**\index{C-X C}\index{jeff-exit}

    This is a slightly more elaborate quit command.
    If the current buffer has been changed, **C-X C** saves the contents of
    the buffer in the associated file (it gets an error if there is no
    associated file). If the current buffer has not been changed, **C-X C**
    acts like **C-C**.

# Moving Around

\index{Moving Around}

C-@,C-space,M-space

:   **set-mark**\index{C-@}\index{C-space}\index{C-space}\index{set-mark}

    Set the value of the mark\index{Mark} to be equal to the dot\index{Dot}.
    Use this command to mark the beginning of a region of text to be
    operated on by a region command\index{Region} such as **C-W**\index{C-W}.
    You can also use this command to mark
    current location so it can be returned to later by **C-X C-X**.
    This command also pushes the new value of the mark onto a 16-entry
    ring of marks\index{mark ring} for the current window.

    If you precede this command
    with an argument (i.e., precede it with a **C-U**),
    it sets the dot to the most recent mark that was stored in the ring,
    and moves that mark to the end of the ring.  It also sets the mark to the next most recent
    mark in the ring, if any.
    By repeatedly using this command with an argument, you can cycle through
    the entire ring of marks, returning to those marked locations in sequence.

C-X C-X

:   **swap-dot-and-mark**\index{C-X C-X}\index{swap-dot-and-mark}

    Exchange the positions of the dot\index{Dot} and the mark\index{Mark}.
    This is useful for switching back and forth between two points in a file.

C-A

:   **goto-bol**\index{C-A}\index{goto-bol}

    Move to the beginning of the current line. Any argument
    is ignored. Always succeeds.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `Home` key.

C-B

:   **back-char**\index{C-B}\index{back-char}

    Move backwards character by character. The number of characters
    to move is specified by the argument. If no argument is given it moves
    backwards by 1 character. A newline counts as a single character. Fails
    if executed at the beginning of the buffer.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `Left` arrow key.

C-E

:   **goto-eol**\index{C-E}\index{goto-eol}

    Move to the end of the current line. Any argument is ignored.
    Always succeeds.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `End` key.

C-F

:   **forw-char**\index{C-F}\index{forw-char}

    Move forwards character by character. The number of characters
    to move is specified by the argument. If no argument is given it moves
    forwards by 1 character. A newline counts as a single character. Fails
    if executed at the end of the buffer.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `Right` arrow key.

C-N

:   **forw-line**\index{C-N}\index{forw-line}

    Move forward by lines. Attempt to preserve the current horizontal
    position. The number of lines to move is specified by the argument. If no
    argument is given it moves by 1 line. Fails if executed at the end of the
    buffer.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `Down` arrow key.

C-P

:   **back-line**\index{C-P}\index{back-line}

    Move backwards by lines. Attempt to preserve the current horizontal
    position. The number of lines to move is specified by the argument. If no
    argument is given it moves by 1 line. Fails if executed at the beginning of
    the buffer.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `Up` arrow key.

C-V

:   **forw-page**\index{C-V}\index{forw-page}

    Move forward by pages. If an argument is given, it specifies the
    number of pages to move. If no argument is given, 1 is assumed.
    A page is a group of lines about 20% smaller than a window.
    If possible, dot is kept where it is; otherwise it it moved
    to the middle of the new page.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `PgDn` key.

    There is a compile time option that makes this command take an argument
    in lines instead of screenfuls. Look in `def.h` for the gory details.

M-V,C-Z

:   **back-page**\index{M-V}\index{C-Z}\index{back-page}

    Move backwards by pages. If an argument is given, it specifies the
    number of pages to move. If no argument is given, 1 is assumed.
    A page is a group of lines about 20% smaller than a window.
    If possible, dot is kept where it is; otherwise it it moved
    to the middle of the new page.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `PgUp` key.

    There is a compile time option that makes this command take an argument
    in lines instead of screenfuls. Look in `def.h` for the gory details.

M-<

:   **goto-bob**\index{M-<}\index{goto-bob}

    Move to the beginning of the buffer. Any argument is ignored.
    Dot is set to the first character of the first line in the buffer.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `Control-Home` key.

M->

:   **goto-eob**\index{M->}\index{goto-eob}

    Move to the end of the buffer. Any argument is ignored. Dot is
    set to the first character in the fake line immediately after the buffer.
    The window is set to display dot near the center of the screen.
    On PCs, this function is bound to the `Control-End` key.

C-X G

:   **goto-line**\index{C-X G}\index{goto-line}

    This command moves the dot to a specific line number.
    If an argument is provided, the dot is moved to that line number.
    If no argument is provided, the command prompts on the echo line
    for a line number.
    This is useful for fixing a source file using error messages produced
    by a compiler.

C-X =

:   **display-position**\index{C-X =}\index{display-position}

    This command displays information about the current position of the
    dot\index{Dot}.  The information is displayed on the echo line\index{Echo line},
    and includes
    the following:

    * The octal and hex values of the character at the dot.

    * The current line number, in decimal.

    * The current screen row and column, in decimal.

    * The approximate position of the dot in the buffer,
    measured as a percentage of the buffer size.

    * The number of characters in the buffer\index{Buffer}.

# Inserting

\index{Inserting}

All characters between hexadecimal 20 and 7E (blank through tilde),
and all characters between hexadecimal A0 and FE (right hand graphics)
are self-inserting. They are inserted into the buffer at the current
location of dot\index{Dot}, and dot moves 1 character to the right.

The **Tab**\index{Tab} (or **C-I**\index{C-I}) key is also self-inserting.
By default, MicroEMACS has fixed tab settings at columns 9, 17, 25, and so on,
but you can change the tab width using the **set-tab-size** command.

Any self-inserting\index{ins-self} character can be given an
argument\index{Argument}.
This argument is
used as a repeat count, and the character is inserted that number of
times. This is useful for creating lines of `*` characters of a specific
length, and other pseudo-graphic things.

Self-inserting keys are all bound to the
function **ins-self**\index{ins-self}.  As with
any key, these keys can be rebound to other functions, but this is not
always advisable.

Word wrapping\index{Word wrap} can be performed by binding a key
to the **ins-self-with-wrap**\index{ins-self-with-wrap} function.
This function is described in the [**Paragraphs**](#paragraphs) section below.

C-M, Return

:   **ins-nl**\index{C-M}\index{Return}\index{Carriage return}\index{ins-nl}

    The Return key works just like you would expect it to work;
    it inserts a newline character. Lines can be split by moving into the middle
    of the line, and inserting a newline.

    On some terminals with slow displays,
    if dot is positioned at end of line,
    and the line after the current line is a blank line,
    then **C-M** does not insert a newline,
    but simply moves to the first position
    on the following line. This lets you create a block of blank space (perhaps
    using **C-O** and then type text into it.  This "feature" can be enabled
    at compile-time by
    setting the "NLMOVE" definition to 1 in `def.h`.

[unbound]

:   **ins-nl-and-indent**\index{C-J}\index{ins-nl-and-indent}\index{Indent}

    This command is like a **C-M** with indentation.
    It inserts a new line, and then inserts enough tabs and spaces to
    duplicate the indentation of the previous line.
    This is useful for entering heavily-indented programs in structured
    languages like PASCAL or C.

[unbound]

:   **borland-indent**\index{C-J}\index{borland-indent}\index{Indent}

    This command is like a **ins-nl-and-indent**, but also attempts to indent
    according to the coding standards in use at Borland in the 1990s.
    If the previous line starts with `{`, or an argument
    of four (i.e. a single `Control-U`) is specified, indent by four spaces. If an
    argument of 16 (i.e. two `Control-U`s) is specified, reduce indentation by four
    spaces.  Otherwise retain the same indentation.

C-J

:   **gnu-indent**\index{C-J}\index{gnu-indent}\index{Indent}

    This command is like a **ins-nl-and-indent**, but also attempts to indent
    according to the GNU coding standards in use at Cygnus in the 1990s.
    If the previous line starts with `{`, `if`, `while`, `for`, `else`, `case, or an argument
    of four (i.e. a single `Control-U`) is specified, indent by two spaces. If an
    argument of 16 (i.e. two `Control-U`s) is specified, reduce indentation by two
    spaces.  Otherwise retain the same indentation.

[unbound]

:   **vmware-indent**\index{C-J}\index{vmware-indent}\index{Indent}

    This command is like a **ins-nl-and-indent**, but also attempts to indent
    according to the coding standards in use at VMware in the 2000s.
    If the previous line starts with `{`, or an argument
    of four (i.e. a single `Control-U`) is specified, indent by three spaces. If an
    argument of 16 (i.e. two `Control-U`s) is specified, reduce indentation by three
    spaces.  Otherwise retain the same indentation.

[unbound]

:   **ruby-indent**\index{C-J}\index{ruby-indent}\index{Indent}

    This command is like a **ins-nl-and-indent**, but also attempts to indent
    according to commonly accepted Ruby conventions.
    If the previous line starts with `{` or one of the many block-start keywords, or an argument
    of four (i.e. a single `Control-U`) is specified, indent by two spaces. If an
    argument of 16 (i.e. two `Control-U`s) is specified, reduce indentation by two
    spaces.  Otherwise retain the same indentation.

C-O

:   **ins-nl-and-backup**\index{C-O}\index{ins-nl-and-backup}\index{Open line}

    This command creates blank lines. To be precise, it inserts
    a newline by doing a **C-M**,
    and then backs up by doing a **C-B**. If dot is at
    the start of a line, this will leave dot sitting on the first character
    of a new blank line.

C-Q, C-X Q

:   **quote**\index{C-Q}\index{C-X Q}\index{quote}\index{Literal character}

    Characters which are special to MicroEMACS can be inserted by
    using this command.
    The next character after the **C-Q** or **C-X Q** is stripped of
    any special meaning. It is simply inserted into the current buffer.
    Any argument specified on the **C-Q**
    or **C-X Q** command is used as the insert
    repeat count.

    The **C-Q** form of the command is the easiest to use. However, some terminals
    demand that MicroEMACS perform XON/XOFF\index{XON/XOFF}\index{Control-Q}
    processing. If this is the case,
    the **C-Q** will be eaten by low level terminal support,
    and will not be usable
    as a command. The **C-X Q** form can always be used.

C-T

:   **twiddle**\index{C-T}\index{twiddle}

    Exchange the two characters on either side of the dot.
    If the the dot is at the end of the line, twiddle the two characters
    before it.  Does nothing if the dot is at the beginning of the line.
    This command is supposedly useful for correcting common
    letter transpositions while entering new text.

M-Tab

:   **set-tab-size**\index{M-Tab}\index{set-tab-size}

    Set the tab size to the value of the argument, which must be
    a positive number greater than 1 (the default tab size is 8).
    This only affects the how
    MicroEMACS displays tabs on the screen; it does not affect
    how tabs are saved when a file is written to disk.  To change
    how MicroEMACS handles tabs when saving a file, see the
    **set-save-tabs** command.

M-I

:  **set-save-tabs**\index{M-I}\index{set-save-tabs}

    By default, MicroEMACS preserves tabs when it writes
    a file to disk.  If you pass a zero argument to this
    command, MicroEMACS will convert tabs to spaces when
    writing a file; the number of spaces is determined
    by the tab size (which you can set using **set-tab-size**).
    If you pass a non-zero argument to this command,
    MicroEMACS will revert back to the default behavior,
    which is to preserve tabs.

[unbound]

:   **just-one-space**\index{just-one-space}

    If the dot is currently sitting over a tab or a space, all consecutive
    tabs and spaces to the left and right of the dot are deleted.
    Then a single
    space is inserted, and the dot is moved 1 character to the right.


# Deleting and Killing

\index{Deleting}\index{Killing}
There are two general classes of commands that remove text from the
buffer: delete commands and kill commands.
Delete commands remove text from the buffer, and throw it away.
Kill commands remove text from the buffer, but save the text in a special
place called the *kill buffer* \index{Kill buffer}.
Kill commands clear the kill buffer only
if the previous command was not a kill command. Multiple kill commands
executed sequentially append text to the kill buffer.

C-D

:   **forw-del-char**\index{C-D}\index{forw-del-char}

    Delete characters to the right of dot. If an argument is
    specified that number of characters is deleted. If no argument is specified
    then 1 character is deleted. In addition, if an argument is specified,
    then the command kills the text instead of deleting it. It fails if
    there are not enough characters to delete between dot and the end of
    the buffer.
    On PCs, this function is also bound to `Del`\index{Del}.

Rubout,C-H,Backspace

:   **back-del-char**\index{Rubout}\index{C-H}\index{Backspace}\index{back-del-char}

    Delete characters to the left of dot. If an argument is
    specified then that number of characters is deleted. If no argument is
    specified then 1 character is deleted. In addition, if an argument is
    specified, the rubout command kills the text instead of deleting it.
    The command fails if there is not enough text between the start of the
    buffer and dot.

C-K

:   **kill-line**\index{C-K}\index{kill-line}

    This is the basic killing command. If there is no argument
    it kills from dot to the end of the line, unless dot is at the
    end of line, when it kills the end of line.
    If a positive argument is specified, **C-K** kills that many lines,
    including the newlines.
    If an argument of 0 is specified, **C-K** kills from the start of the current
    line to dot.
    Finally, if a negative argument is specified, **C-K** kills backwards over
    abs(arg) newlines. This command fails if there aren't enough characters
    left in the buffer to be killed.

C-W

:   **kill-region**\index{C-W}\index{kill-region}\index{Region}

    Kill all of the text enclosed in the region, and put it into
    the kill buffer.
    If an argument is specified, then delete the text instead of killing it;
    this is useful
    when memory fills up and MicroEMACS can't allocate space for the
    kill buffer.  The value of the argument, if any, is ignored.

C-Y

:   **yank**\index{C-Y}\index{yank}

    Insert the text from the kill buffer into the current buffer
    at dot. If an argument is specified, it specifies the number of times
    the text is yanked. If no argument is specified, yank the text back
    once. Dot is advanced over the inserted text, as if the text had
    been typed in normally. Always succeeds.

M-W

:   **copy-region**\index{M-W}\index{copy-region}\index{Region}

    Put all of the text enclosed in the region into the kill buffer,
    without deleting it from the current buffer.
    This is similar to **C-W** followed by **C-Y**, except that the buffer is
    not flagged as having been changed.

C-X C-O

:   **del-blank-lines**\index{C-X C-O}\index{del-blank-lines}

    Delete blank lines around dot.
    If dot is sitting on a
    blank line, this command deletes all the blank lines
    above and below the current line. If it is sitting
    on a non blank line then it deletes all of the
    blank lines after the line.
    Any argument is ignored.

# Words

\index{Words}
MicroEMACS has commands that manipulate words. In full EMACS the characters
that make up words can be changed by the user. In MicroEMACS, they are
fixed, and include the upper and lower case letters, the dollar sign
$ and the underline _. This set of characters is intended more
for editing programs, but the word commands still work reasonably
when editing text.

M-B

:   **back-word**\index{M-B}\index{back-word}

    The backward word command moves dot backward by words, stopping
    on the first character of the word. If an argument is specified, it is the
    number of words over which to move. The default argument is 1.
    On PC-DOS and FlexOS this function is also bound to `C-Left`.

M-C

:   **cap-word**\index{M-C}\index{cap-word}

    This command moves forward over a word, converting all characters
    in the word to lower case except the first one, which is converted to
    upper case. If an argument is supplied, it must be positive, and it specifies
    the number of words over which to move.

M-D

:   **forw-del-word**\index{M-D}\index{forw-del-word}

    The delete word command moves dot forward by words, and kills
    any characters over which it moves. If an argument is specified, it is the
    number of words over which to move. The default argument is 1.

M-F

:   **forw-word**\index{M-F}\index{forw-word}

    The forward word command moves dot forward by words, stopping
    on the first non-word character. If an argument is specified, it is the
    number of words over which to move. The default argument is 1.
    On PC-DOS and FlexOS this function is also bound to `C-Right`.

M-L

:   **lower-word**\index{M-L}\index{lower-word}

    This command moves forward over a word, converting it to lower
    case. If an argument is supplied, it must be positive, and it specifies the
    number of words over which to move.

M-C-H

:   **back-del-word**\index{M-C-H}\index{back-del-word}

    The backward delete word command moves backward by words, stopping
    on the first character of the word, and killing as it moves. If an argument
    is present, it specifies the number of words over which to move. The
    default argument is 1.

M-Rubout

:   **back-del-word**\index{M-Rubout}\index{back-del-word}

    This command is the same as **M-C-H**.
    It exists only to preserve the
    symmetry between the word commands and the character commands (both backspace
    and rubout are backward delete character).

M-U

:   **upper-word**\index{M-U}\index{upper-word}

    This command moves forward over a word, converting it to upper
    case. If an argument is supplied, it must be positive, and it specifies the
    number of words over which to move.

# Paragraphs

\index{Paragraphs}
MicroEMACS has commands that deal with paragraphs.  A paragraph
is a sequences of lines separated by one or more of the following:

* Blank lines.

* Lines beginning with a space or tab character.

* Lines beginning with the "@" character (SCRIBE, FinalWord, and Sprint
  command lines).

* Lines beginning with the "." character (NROFF and PROFF command lines).

There are commands for "filling" a paragraph, moving dot to
the start or end of a paragraph, setting the fill column\index{Fill column},
and performing automatic word wrap\index{Word wrap}.

[unbound]

:   **set-fill-column**\index{set-fill-column}

    This command sets the current fill column\index{Fill column} to its argument
    (remember that the argument is entered as `Control-U` and a
    decimal number preceding the command).  If no argument is present,
    the column of the current location of the cursor (the dot) is used instead.
    The fill column is used by the **fill-paragraph**
    and **ins-self-with-wrap** commands.
    The default fill column is 70.

M-[

:   **back-paragraph**\index{M-[}\index{back-paragraph}

    This command moves the dot to the beginning of the current paragraph.
    If the dot is not in a paragraph when this command is entered,
    it is moved to the beginning of the preceding paragraph.
    If an argument is provided, the dot is moved by that many paragraphs.

    If you are using MicroEMACS with a serial terminal, you may have
    to type `ESCAPE` followed by two `[` characters to invoke this command.
    The reason is that ESCAPE-[ is the prefix produced by
    function keys on VT-100 compatible\index{VT-100} terminals.

M-]

:   **forw-paragraph**\index{M-]}\index{forw-paragraph}

    This command moves the dot to
    the end of the current paragraph (actually to first separator line after
    the paragraph).
    If the dot is not in a paragraph when this command is entered,
    it is moved to the end of the following paragraph.
    If an argument is provided, the dot is moved by that many paragraphs.

M-J

:   **fill-paragraph**\index{M-J}\index{fill-paragraph}

    This command "fills" the current paragraph.  It inserts or
    deletes spaces and line breaks between words as needed to cause
    the text of each line to be filled out to (but no farther than)
    the current fill column.  The text is thus filled, but not
    right-justified.  The dot is then placed at the end of the
    last line of the paragraph.

M-C-W

:   **kill-paragraph**\index{M-C-W}\index{kill-paragraph}

    This command deletes the current paragraph.  If an argument is
    provided, that many paragraphs are deleted.

[unbound]

:   **ins-self-with-wrap**\index{ins-self-with-wrap}\index{Word wrap}

    This command inserts the key that invoked it into the buffer
    at the current location of dot, and dot moves 1 character to the right.
    Then, if dot has gone past the current fill column\index{Fill column},
    a line break is
    inserted in front of the first word in the line
    that extends past the fill column.  Thus the current line is
    "filled", and a new line is created that contains the words from
    the current line that wouldn't fit within the fill column.

    Normally, this command
    is not bound to any key.  If you bind this command to
    the space key, the effect will be similar to the word-wrapping mode
    in MINCE\index{MINCE}.

# Case Conversion

\index{Case Conversion}
In addition to the word mode case conversion commands, MicroEMACS has
commands to modify the case of large blocks of text. These commands should
be used with caution because they cause major damage to (potentially)
large areas of the buffer.

C-X C-L

:   **lower-region**\index{C-X C-L}\index{lower-region}\index{Region}

    The lowercase region command converts all of the characters
    between dot and mark into lower case.

C-X C-U

:   **upper-region**\index{C-X C-U}\index{upper-region}\index{Region}

    The uppercase region command converts all of the characters
    between dot and mark into upper case.

# Searching and Spelling

\index{Searching}
Search commands move though the buffer, in either the forward or the reverse
direction, looking for text that matches a search pattern. Search commands
prompt for the search pattern in the echo line. The search pattern used
by the last search command is remembered, and displayed in the prompt. If
you want to use this pattern again, just hit carriage return at the
prompt.

In search strings, all characters stand for themselves, and all searches
are normally case insensitive.  The case insensitivity may be
defeated with the "fold-case"\index{fold-case}\index{Case folding}
command, described below.
The newline characters at the ends of the lines are
considered to have hexadecimal value 0A, and can be matched by a linefeed
(**Control-J**) in the search string.

A carriage return\index{Carriage return} can be searched
for by preceding it with `Control-Q` in the search string.
On PC-DOS\index{PC-DOS}, CP/M\index{CP/M} and FlexOS\index{FlexOS}
this will not match the carriage return in the CR-LF character pair
that normally terminates a line of text.  It will only match a bare
carriage return that has no following line feed.

MicroEMACS supports regular expression\index{regular expressons}
searches using a subset of POSIX regular expressions:

* `.` (dot) matches any character

* character classes (square brackets with optional ^ negation operator)

* groups (parentheses)

* alternatives (`|`)

* `^` (start of line) and `$` (end of line)

* `?` (zero or one occurrence)

* `*` (zero or more occurrences)

* `+` (one or more occurrences)

C-S, M-S

:   **forw-search**\index{C-S}\index{M-S}\index{forw-search}

    Search forward, from the current location, toward the end of
    the buffer. If found, dot is positioned after the matched text. If the
    text is not found, dot does not move.

    The **C-S**\index{Control-S}
    form of the command is not usable if the terminal being used
    required XON/XOFF\index{XON/XOFF} support.
    In fact, if you use this format of the command
    on such a terminal, it will hang until you type **C-Q**.

    The **M-S** form of this command is easily entered on the Z-29
    \index{Zenith Z-29} keyboard
    by pressing the `F1` key.

C-R

:   **back-search**\index{C-R}\index{back-search}

    Search reverse, from the current location, toward the front of
    the buffer. If found, dot is positioned at the first character of the
    matched text. If the text is not found, dot does not move.

M-C-S

:   **forw-regexp-search**

    Similar to **forw-search**, except that the search string is
    a regular expression, and searches cannot cross line boundaries.

M-C-R

:   **back-regexp-search**

    Similar to **back-search**, except that the search string is
    a regular expression, and searches cannot cross line boundaries.

M-C-F

:   **fold-case**\index{M-C-F}\index{fold-case}\index{Case folding}

    Enable or disable case folding in searches, depending on the
    argument to the command.  If the argument is zero, case folding
    is disabled, and searches will be sensitive to case.  If the
    argument is non-zero, case folding is enabled, and searches
    will NOT be sensitive to case.

M-P

:   **search-paren**\index{M-P}\index{search-paren}

    Search for a match of the character at the dot.  If the character
    is a parenthesis or bracketing character, move the dot to the matching
    parenthesis or bracket, taking into account nesting and C-style
    comments.  A parenthesis or bracketing character is one of the
    following: (){}[]<>

Pad-1,Shift-5

:   **search-again**\index{Pad-1}\index{Shift-5}\index{search-again}

    Repeat the last forw-search command
    (**C-S, M-S**) or prev-search command (**C-R, M-R**),
    without prompting for a string.  This command is bound to two keys
    on the numeric keypad of the Z-29\index{Zenith Z-29}
    terminal: the `1` key, and the shifted
    `5` key.
    On PCs, this function is also bound to `F9`.

C-X S

:   **forw-i-search**\index{C-X S}\index{forw-i-search}\index{Incremental search}

    Enters incremental search mode, with
    the initial search direction being forward.  In incremental search mode
    the following keys are recognized.

    * **C-N** finds the next occurence of the string (if it is first thing typed,
    reuse the previous string).

    * **C-P** finds the previous occurence of the string
    (if it is the first thing typed, reuse the previous string).

    * **C-S** (or **C-F**) switches the search direction to forward,
    and finds the next occurrence
    of the string.

    * **C-R** (or **C-B**) switches the search direction to reverse,
    and finds the next occurrence
    of the string.

    * **C-Q** (or **C-^**) quotes the next character (allows searching for C-N, etc.).

    * **ESC** exits from incremental search mode.

    * **C-G** restores dot to original location before incremental search mode
    was entered, then exits from incremental search mode.

    * **DEL** undoes the effect of the last character typed in the search string.

    * **C-U**, **C-X**, **C-J**, and all non-Control
    characters accumulate into search string.

    * All other control characters exit from incremental search mode and
    are interpreted as normal commands.

C-X R

:   **back-i-search**\index{C-X R}\index{back-i-search}

    Enters incremental search mode, with the initial search direction
    being reverse.
    Otherwise identical to **C-X S**.

M-Q,M-%

:   **query-replace**\index{M-Q}\index{M-%}\index{query-replace}

    Search and replace with query.  This command prompts for
    a search string and a replace string, then searches forward for the
    search string.  After each occurrence of the search string is found,
    the dot is placed after the string, and
    the user is prompted for action.  Enter one of the following characters:

    * **space** or **,** (comma) causes the string to be replaced, and the
    next occurrence is searched.

    * **.** (period) causes the string to replaced, and quits the search.

    * **n** causes the string to be skipped without being replaced, and
    the next occurrence is searched.

    * **!** causes all subsequent occurrences of the string to be replaced
    without prompting.

    * **Control-G** quits the search without any further replacements.

    Normally this command adjusts the capitalization of the new string to
    match the old string when it performs a replacement.
    You can defeat this "feature"
    if you prefix this command with an argument (the argument value is ignored).

M-R

:   **replace-string**\index{M-R}\index{replace-string}

    Prompt for a search string and a replacement string,
    then search forward for all occurrences of the search string, replacing
    each one with the replacement string.  Do
    not prompt the user for
    confirmation at each replacement, as in the **query-replace** command.

    Normally this command adjusts the capitalization of the new string to
    match the old string when it performs a replacement.
    You can defeat this "feature"
    if you prefix this command with an argument (the argument value is ignored).

M-?

:   **reg-query-replace**\index{M-?}\index{reg-query-replace}

    Similar to **query-replace**, except that the search string is a
    regular expression, and the replacement string can contain
    the following special characters:

    * `&` stands for the entire matched string.

    * `\n`, where `n` is a digit in the range 0-9, stands for the nth
      matched group (where groups are delineated by parentheses in the
      regular expression pattern).

    * `\` followed  by either `\` or `&` stands for that character itself,
      without the leading `\`.

M-/

:   **rep-replace**\index{M-/}\index{reg-replace}

    Similar to **reg-query-replace**, except that the user is prompted
    to confirm each replacement, as in **query-replace**.

C-X I

:   **spell-region**\index{C-X I}\index{spell-region}

    This command uses `ispell` to spell-check the current region
    (the text between the mark and the dot).  At each misspelled
    word, MicroEMACS prompts for an action:

    * **q** or **C-G** aborts the spell checking.

    * **Space** ignores the misspelled word

    * **a** ignores the misspelled word and adds it to ispell's list of
    words to ignore in the future.

    * **0** to **9** replaces the misspelled word with one of up to ten
    suggestions; the suggestions are shown in the prompt on the echo line.

    * **r** prompts for a string to replace the word.

M-\$

:   **spell-word**\index{M-\$}\index{spell-word}

    Similar to **spell-region**, except that it checks only the word under
    the cursor.

# Files

\index{Files}

C-X C-F

:   **set-file-name**

    This command prompts in the echo line for a file name\index{File name},
    which becomes the new associated file name for the current buffer\index{Buffer}.

C-X C-R

:   **file-read**\index{C-X C-R}\index{file-read}\index{File, reading}\index{Reading a file}

    This command prompts in the echo line for a file name,
    then it deletes all of the text in the current buffer and reads in the
    file. The associated file name is set to the name of the file just
    read. The number of lines read is displayed in the echo line.

C-X C-I

:   **file-insert**\index{C-X C-I}\index{file-insert}\index{File, inserting}\index{Inserting a file}

    This command prompts in the echo line for a file name,
    then reads in the
    file, inserting its contents at the dot in the current buffer.
    The number of lines read is displayed in the echo line.
    The file name associated with the current buffer is not changed.

C-X C-S, M-T

:   **file-save**\index{C-X C-S}\index{M-T}\index{file-save}\index{File, saving}\index{Saving a file}

    This command writes the contents of the current buffer
    to its associated file. The "changed" flag for the current buffer
    \index{Buffer changed flag} is
    reset. It is an error to use this command in a buffer which lacks
    an associated file name. This command is a no-operation if the
    buffer has not been changed since the last write.

    If you used the **-b** option when you invoked MicroEMACS, and
    this is first time a **file-save** command has been performed
    on the file, MicroEMACS will create a backup\index{Backup file} of the file.
    See the section [**Starting**](#starting) for more information on backups.

    The **C-X C-S**\index{Control-S} form of the command is not usable if the terminal being used
    required XON/XOFF\index{XON/XOFF} support.
    In fact, if you use this format of the command
    on such a terminal, it will hang until you type **C-Q**.

    The **M-T** form of this command is easily entered on the
    Z-29\index{Zenith Z-29} keyboard
    by pressing the `F2` key.  On PCs, this function is also bound to `F2`.

C-X C-V

:   **file-visit**\index{C-X C-V}\index{file-visit}\index{File, visiting}\index{Visiting a file}

    This command selects a file for editing. It prompts for
    a file name in the echo line. It then looks through all of the buffers
    for a buffer whose associated file name is the same as the file being
    selected. If a buffer is found, it just switches to that buffer.
    Otherwise it creates a new buffer, (fabricating a name from the last
    part of the new file name), reads the file into it, and switches to the
    buffer.

    If the desired new buffer name is not unique (perhaps you tried to
    visit a file in some other directory with the same name as a file already
    read in) the command will prompt for a new buffer name. You can either
    supply a buffer name, or just type newline to overwrite the old
    buffer.

    On PCs, this function is also bound to `F3`.

C-X C-W

:   **file-write**\index{C-X C-W}\index{file-write}\index{File, writing}\index{Writing a file}

    This command prompts in the echo line for a file name,
    then it writes the contents of the current buffer to that file. The
    "changed" flag for the current buffer is reset, and the supplied file
    name becomes the associated file name for the current buffer.

# Keyboard Macros

\index{Keyboard Macros}
\index{Macro}
Keyboard macros simplify a large class of repetitious editing tasks.
The basic idea is simple. A set of keystrokes can be collected into a
group, and then the group may be replayed any number of times.

There is only one keyboard macro.  However, you can effectively have
more than one macro by giving the current keyboard macro a name.
Otherwise, when you define a new keyboard macro, the old one is erased.

You can also save macros for use in future editing sessions, with
the ins-macro\index{ins-macro} function.

C-X (

:   **start-macro**\index{C-X (}\index{start-macro}

    This command starts the collection of a keyboard macro. All
    keystrokes up to the next **C-X )** will be gathered up,
    and may be replayed by
    the execute keyboard macro command.

C-X )

:   **end-macro**\index{C-X )}\index{end-macro}

    This command stops the collection of a keyboard macro.

C-X E

:   **execute-macro**\index{C-X E}\index{execute-macro}

    The execute keyboard macro command replays the current keyboard
    macro. If an argument is present, it specifies the number of times the macro
    should be executed. If no argument is present, it runs the macro once.
    Execution of the macro stops if an error occurs (such as a failed
    search).

[unbound]

:   **name-macro**\index{name-macro}

    This command saves the current keyboard macro and gives it a name.
    MicroEMACS prompts you for the name to assign to the macro.  The macro name
    can then be used as an extended command\index{Extended command}
    (using `ESC X`\index{ESC X}),
    or can be bound to a key using
    **bind-to-key**, just as a normal command.

[unbound]

:   **ins-macro**\index{ins-macro}

    This commands inserts the contents of a macro into the current
    buffer in a format that can be used later in a profile\index{Profile}.
    MicroEMACS prompts for the name of the macro.  If you don't enter a name,
    the current macro is used.

# Buffer Management

\index{Buffer Management}
\index{Buffer}
Previous sections have made references to the text in "the buffer",
which implied that there is only one buffer. This is not true; MicroEMACS
allows any number of buffers, memory space permitting.

Each buffer has its own buffer name\index{Buffer name} (a 16 character string),
and optional associated file name\index{File name},
and a block of text. A value of dot\index{Dot} and mark\index{Mark}
is also associated with
any buffer that is not currently being displayed. This remembered value
of dot and mark makes a buffer come back in approximately the same state
as it was when it was hidden.

Also associated with each buffer is a changed flag\index{Buffer changed flag}.
This flag is set
when the text in the buffer is modified, and reset when the text in the
buffer is written out to its associated file. MicroEMACS will always ask
for confirmation before executing a command that would cause changed
text to be lost.

C-X C-B

:   **display-buffers**\index{C-X C-B}\index{display-buffers}\index{Buffer list}

    Create a pop-up window\index{Window} on the screen, and display it in
    the name, size (in characters), associated file name, and changed flag
    of all buffers. This command works by creating a special buffer which
    contains the text of the display, and then selecting it in a window. You
    can switch into this window if you like. You can even edit the text.
    MicroEMACS makes no attempt to keep a buffer list which is on the screen
    updated as other buffers are edited; however, another **C-X C-B** command
    will cause the display to be updated in place.
    On PCs, this function is also bound to `F6`.

C-X B

:   **use-buffer**\index{C-X B}\index{use-buffer}

    This command prompts for a buffer name, and then switches
    the buffer being displayed in the current window to that buffer. The
    buffer will be created if it does not exist.

    If you do not enter a buffer name, this command will use the name of the
    last buffer that you switched from with **C-X B**.  Thus, you can
    use **C-X B** repeatedly to switch between two buffers without entering
    their names each time.

[unbound]

:   **forw-buffer**\index{forw-buffer}

    This command switches the buffer being displayed to the next buffer
    in the buffer list\index{Buffer list}.
    If the end of the buffer list is reached, switch
    to the first buffer in the list.  The list of buffers can be displayed
    with **C-X C-B**.   When this command is bound to a key, it
    is useful for quickly flipping among the files being edited.
    On PCs this command is bound to `F8`.

[unbound]

:   **back-buffer**\index{back-buffer}

    This command is similar to **forw-buffer**, except that it
    switches the buffer being displayed to the previous buffer
    in the buffer list\index{Buffer list}.

C-X K

:   **kill-buffer**\index{C-X K}\index{kill-buffer}

    This command prompts for a buffer name, and then destroys
    the buffer with that name. It will ask for permission to destroy the
    buffer if the text has been changed since it was written to the associated
    file. You cannot delete a buffer that is being displayed.

C-X C-Q

:   **toggle-readonly**\index{C-X C-Q}\index{toggle-readonly}\index{read-only}

    This command toggles the read-only flag on the current buffer:
    if the buffer is currently read-only, it is made read-write;
    otherwise it is made read-only.  This can be useful to counteract
    the effect of [starting MicroEMACS](#starting) with the `-r` option.

# Window Management

\index{Window Management}\index{Window}
MicroEMACS lets you have multiple windows on the screen.
Each window has its own mode line\index{mode line},
its own value of dot\index{Dot} and mark\index{Mark},
and its own associated buffer\index{Buffer}.
If you have a buffer displayed in more
that one window and you edit a line, it is updated in all windows.

A window is as only wide as can fit on your terminal.
If a text line is too long to be displayed in a window, the last
column is displayed as a `$` character.  However,
MicroEMACS will let you
view long lines by automatically scrolling the window left or right
if you move the cursor past the left or right edges of the window.
When MicroEMACS performs a horizontal scroll, it will attempt to
reframe the window so that the cursor is centered horizontally.

C-L

:   **refresh**\index{C-L}\index{refresh}

    This command clears the screen, and completely redisplays all
    of the text is all of the windows. It is useful if a line error has garbaged
    your screen.

    If you give **C-L** an argument, it will attempt to split the
    screen vertically into that number of side-by-side pages.  This has the effect
    of giving you a screen that has more rows but fewer columns than normal.
    To restore the screen to normal, give an argument of 1.
    Currently this feature only works with the ncurses display code;
    see [**Building with GCC**](#building-with-gcc).

C-X 2

:   **split-window**\index{C-X 2}\index{split-window}

    This is the basic window making command. The current window
    is split in two. Each window is displaying the same buffer, and has
    the same value of dot and mark. The window must be at least three lines
    high, otherwise there isn't enough room for two text lines and the
    new mode line. Any argument is ignored.

    After the you create a window, you usually switch it to a private
    buffer using **C-X B**\index{C-X B}
    or (perhaps more often) **C-X C-V**\index{C-X C-V}.
    Note that because
    both windows are displaying the same buffer, reading a file in one
    window with **C-X C-R**\index{C-X C-R} probably does not do what you want.

C-X 1

:   **only-window**\index{C-X 1}\index{only-window}

    This is the basic window destroying command. All windows but
    the current window are removed from the screen. The current window grows
    to fill the vacated screen space. Any argument is ignored.
    On PCs, this command is also bound to `F10`.

C-X N, C-X O

:   **forw-window**\index{C-X N}\index{C-X O}\index{forw-window}

    Move to the next window down the screen.
    If the current window
    is the bottom window, move to the top window. Ignores any argument.

C-X P

:   **back-window**\index{C-X P}\index{back-window}

    Move to the previous window up the screen. If the current window
    is the top window, move to the bottom window. Ignores any argument.

C-X Z

:   **enlarge-window**\index{C-X Z}\index{enlarge-window}

    The current window is enlarged, if possible. Any argument is
    used as a "number of lines by which to grow". The default argument is 1.
    Screen space is stolen from the window immediately below the current
    window. If the current window is the bottom window on the screen then
    space is stolen from the window immediately above the current window.
    You cannot steal all of the lines away from a window.

C-X C-N

:   **down-window**\index{C-X C-N}\index{down-window}

    Scroll the current window down. Any argument is used as a
    "number of lines by which to scroll" count. The default argument is 1.
    On PCs, this command is also bound to `C-PgDn`.

C-X C-P

:   **up-window**\index{C-X C-P}\index{up-window}

    Scroll the current window up. Any argument is used as a
    "number of lines by which to scroll" count. The default argument is 1.
    On PCs, this command is also bound to `C-PgUp`.

C-X C-Z

:   **shrink-window**\index{C-X C-Z}\index{shrink-window}

    The current window is shrunk, if possible. Any argument is
    used as a "number of lines by which to shrink". The default argument is 1.
    Screen space is given to the window immediately below the current window.
    If the current window is the bottom window on the screen, the space is
    given to the window immediately above the current window. You cannot shrink
    a window out of existence.

M-!

:   **reposition-window**\index{M-!}\index{reposition-window}

    This command is used to control the line of a window upon
    which dot is displayed. If its argument is positive, then that number is
    taken to be the origin 1 line number of the current window upon which
    the line containing dot should be placed. If its argument is 0, then dot
    is moved to the center of the window. If the number is less then zero
    then it is taken to be the negation of the origin 1 line number of the
    current window starting at the bottom upon which the line containing dot
    should be placed. If no argument is supplied, a default argument of 1 is
    used; This lets **M-!** function as a "move dot to the top of the window"
    command, which is very useful.

C-X +

:   **balance-windows**\index{C-X +}\index{balance-windows}

    This command adjusts the windows so that they all have approximately
    the same height.  This is useful after several **split-window**
    commands have created some windows that are too small.

# Messages

\index{Messages}
MicroEMACS has a message system that allows commands to display
error or status messages
that are too long to
fit on the echo line\index{Echo line}.  At present, only
the **display-version** command uses the message system, but other commands
may use it in the future.

[unbound]

:   **display-message**\index{display-message}

    Display the message lines one at a time on the echo line, then enter
    a special message display mode, in which certain keys have the following
    meanings:

    * **C-N, Space, Return**: go forward one line, and quit if the end of
    the message has been reached.

    * **C-P, C-H, Backspace**: go backward one line.

    * **C-G**: quit, leave the message unchanged.

    * **C-C**: quit, erase the portion of the message already read, but leave
    the remainder of the message unchanged.

M-C-V

:   **display-version**\index{M-C-V}\index{display-version}\index{Version}

    Copy the version strings into the message buffer, then execute
    a **display-message** command (see above).  Use this command to
    find out which version of MicroEMACS you are running.

# Key Binding Commands

\index{Key Binding Commands}\index{Key binding}
There are several commands in MicroEMACS that can be used to examine
or change key bindings.  These commands are not normally
bound to a particular key.  As with any unbound commands (also
called "extended" commands)\index{Extended command},
they can be used by entering **M-X**\index{M-X} (`ESC X`\index{ESC X}),
then typing the command name
in response to the prompt `:` on the echo line.

[unbound]

:   **display-bindings**\index{display-bindings}

    This command creates a pop-up window\index{Window} that contains
    a table of the current keyboard bindings.  Each entry in the table
    contains the key name, and the name of the command that the key invokes.
    You can save this table to a file by using **C-X N**\index{C-X N}
    to switch to the
    window displaying the table, then using **C-X C-W**\index{C-X C-W}
    to write the table
    to a file.

[unbound]

:   **bind-to-key**\index{bind-to-key}

    This command prompts the user with `Function:` for
    a command name, then prompts with `Key:` for a key (or key combination).
    The command is then bound to that key, so that
    all subsequent uses of that key cause the associated command to be
    executed.  The command name can be any of those listed by the
    **display-bindings** command, or any of the commands described in
    this section.

[unbound]

:   **help**\index{help}

    This command waits for the user to enter a key, then displays
    on the echo line the command name that is bound to that key.
    On PCs, this function is bound to `F1`.

# Tags

\index{tags}
MicroEMACS can use the source-code tagging programs `cscope`\index{cscope} and `ctags`\index{ctags}
to make it easier to find functions and variables in C programs.  The `find-` functions
prompt for a name to find, but they also attempt to extract a name from the
current buffer and location, to be used if you do not enter a name and simply hit
`Enter`.

M-,

:   **find-cscope**\index{find-cscope}

    This command prompts for an identifier, then uses `cscope` to find the first
    occurence of the identifier.  Usually, the first occurrence is the one
    that defines the identifier.  The command then visits the corresponding
    file and places the dot at the line containing the identifier.  On PCs,
    this function is also bound to `F11`.

M-G

:   **find-grep**\index{find-grep}

    This command prompts for a string, then uses `cscope`'s "grep" function to find the first
    occurence of the string.  The command then visits the corresponding
    file and places the dot at the line containing the string.

[unbound]

:   **next-cscope**\index{next-cscope}

    This command uses `cscope` finds the next occurrence of an identifier that
    was found in a previous `find-cscope` or `find-grep` command.  On PCs, this
    function is bound to `F12`.

M-.

:   **find-tag**\index{find-tag}

    This command prompts for an identifier, then reads the `TAGS` file (generated
    by `ctags`) to find an occurrence of the identifier.  If no argument is present,
    the command finds the first occurrence; if an argument is present, the command
    finds the next occurence.  The command then visits the corresponding
    file and places the dot at the line containing the identifier.

# GCC errors

\index{GCC errors}
MicroEMACS is able to parse a file containing gcc error messages, and
load the source files mentioned in the error messages.  Typically, you would
save the error messages to a file when running `make`:

    make >&errs

Then load the resulting `errs` file into MicroEMACS and use
the following command to process the error messages contained within:

M-C-E

:   **gcc-error**\index{gcc-error}

    This command looks for the next gcc error message in the current buffer.
    If one is found, then a new window is opened if there is currently only
    one window; otherwise the next window below the current one is used.
    MicroEMACS reads into that window the file indicated in
    the error message, positions the cursor at the line and column given
    in the error message, and displays the remainder of the error message
    in the echo line.  To find the next error location, switch
    back to the error buffer (using the `back-window` command (**C-X P**)
    or the `forw-window` command (**C-X N**)),
    and issue this command again.

# Undo

MicroEMACS supports an undo\index{Undo}/redo facility.  It saves
information about the last 100 commands that modified a given buffer,
so that these commands can be undone.  Each buffer has its own set of
undo records.  MicroEMACS treats consecutive typing of normal (non-command)
keys as a single operation; this makes it less tedious to undo large
amounts of typing.

The most recent undo operation(s) can be reversed with the `redo`
command.  By using `undo` and `redo` in succession, you can go
backwards and forwards in time through the recent history of a buffer.
But if you modify the buffer in any way other than through `undo` or
`redo`, the ability to `redo` will be lost until another `undo` is
performed.  This prevents conflicting changes from being made
to a buffer.

C-X U

:   **undo**\index{undo}

    This command undoes the most recent operation that modified the current buffer.
    On PCs, this function is also bound to `F5`.

[unbound]

:   **redo**\index{redo}

    This command undoes the most recent undo.  On PCs, this function is bound to `F7`.

# Profiles

\index{Profiles}\index{Profile}
A profile is a file that contain a sequence of characters that
MicroEMACS can read as if the file were a keyboard.  Thus
a profile is similar to a macro\index{Macro}, but because it is a file
it doesn't go away when you leave MicroEMACS.  You can think of a profile as
an editor command file\index{Command file}.

When MicroEMACS starts\index{Starting},
it reads and executes a startup profile, after it reads the
file(s) you specify on the command line (if any).  You might use the
startup profile to set up some favorite key bindings\index{Key binding},
or define a macro\index{Macro},
or read in more files\index{File, reading}\index{Reading a file}.

You can use the **-p profile** option when you invoke MicroEMACS to specify
the name of the startup profile.  If you don't use this option, MicroEMACS
will use a default profile name.
The name of the default
profile is `ME.PRO` on all systems except UNIX\index{UNIX}, where it is
named `.mepro`.  MicroEMACS will look for this profile in the
current directory.  If the profile is not found, MicroEMACS will
look in a second directory, as follows:

* On UNIX\index{UNIX} and PC-DOS\index{PC-DOS},
the directory indicated by the environment string
**HOME**, if defined.

* On FlexOS\index{FlexOS}, the **home:** directory or device.

* On CP/M-68K\index{CP/M}, user area 0 of the current drive.

* On VMS\index{VMS}, the **sys$login** directory.

A profile consists of a series of tokens separated by white space
or newlines.  A token can be a literal string, key name, or command
name.

1.  **Literal string:** a series of characters surrounded by double quotes (").
    The characters within the quotes are interpreted by MicroEMACS exactly
    as if you had typed them on the keyboard.  Certain control characters
    may be placed in the string using the following escape sequences:

    \\n

    :   linefeed

    \\t

    :   tab

    \\b

    :   backspace

    \\r

    :   carriage return

    \\f

    :   form feed

    \\\\

    :   backslash

    \\"

    :   double quote

    Other control characters can be placed in the string by preceding
    them with the Control-Q (quote)\index{Control-Q}\index{quote} character.

    A quoted string must always follow a command that normally
    prompt the user to enter a response string (for example, the search command
    **C-S**).  The
    last character in the response string must be a carriage return
    (written as \\r).

2.  **Key name:** the name of a MicroEMACS key
    surrounded by brackets [].
    Key names use the conventions established in this manual.  Examples:

    [C-F]

    :   means "Control-F"

    [M-C-V]

    :   means "ESC Control-F"

    [M-L]

    :   means "ESC L"

    [C-X E]

    :   means "Control-X E"

    [C-X C-S]

    :   means "Control-X Control-S"

    You can use the **display-bindings**\index{display-bindings}
    extended command to get a partial
    list of key names, or see the [**Wall Chart**](#wall-chart) section below.

    MicroEMACS converts the key name to the corresponding internal key code.
    Only one key name is allowed within a single pair of brackets.

3.  **Commands name:** simply the name of any MicroEMACS command, whether
    it is bound to a key or not.  MicroEMACS prefixes the command name
    with **ESC X**, and follows it with a **Return**, before interpreting
    the command.  This simulates the keystrokes that you would enter at
    the keyboard to
    invoke an extended command\index{extended command}.

4.  **Decimal number:** a series of digits, optionally preceded by a
    minus sign ("-").  It is equivalent to typing Control-U, followed
    by the number, on the keyboard.  Placing a number before
    a command is a convenient method of supplying a numeric argument
    \index{Argument} to the command.

As an example, consider the following line from a profile:

    bind-to-key "help\r" [m-h]

This is equivalent the following key sequence typed at the keyboard:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
ESC X\index{ESC X} bind-to-key\index{bind-to-key} RETURN help\index{help} RETURN ESC H
\end{Verbatim}

Note especially the '\\r' character in the quoted string: this must
be present
because MicroEMACS always expects you to type **Return**
in response to the `Function:` prompt of the **bind-to-key** command.
This is true for all commands that prompt on the echo line for a reply.

Here is a profile that moves the cursor down by 10 lines, and which
demonstrates the use of a numeric argument to a command:

    10 forw-line

Here is a profile that changes all occurrences
of the string "plugh" to "xyzzy" in the current file, then saves the
changes and quits.

    replace-string\index{replace-string} "plugh\r" "xyzzy\r" file-save quit

Here is a profile that causes the `Control-J` key
to indent according to Ruby conventions\index{ruby-indent}.

    bind-to-key "ruby-indent\r" [C-J]

\index{file-save}\index{quit}
You can automate this kind of global change with the **-p** option
when you invoke MicroEMACS.  If you name the above profile
`junk.pro`, you can perform a global change on a file,
without entering any MicroEMACS commands,
by invoking MicroEMACS with the following:

    pe -p junk.pro filename

You can tell MicroEMACS to read a profile at any time, with the
following command.

**C-X F**

:   **read-profile**\index{C-X F}\index{read-profile}

    This command prompts you for the name of a profile.
    MicroEMACS then reads its subsequent commands from the specified
    profile, until the end of the file is encountered.  While
    a profile is being processed, command
    errors are reported, but otherwise no screen activity takes place
    (unless the "echo" command is used in the profile).
    You cannot nest profiles by putting a [C-X F] or read-profile command in
    a profile.  Execution of a profile does *not* stop if an error occurs (such
    as a failed search).

You can display messages on the echo line\index{Echo line} during profile
processing (or at any other time) with the following command.

**C-X C-E**

:   **echo**\index{C-X C-E}\index{echo}

    This command prompts you to enter a line of text.
    MicroEMACS then displays the text on the echo line.
    This command might be useful for displaying progress
    during a time-consuming profile.  Here is an example
    of the use of the echo command in a profile:

        echo "Changing all CDOS references...\r"
        replace-string "CDOS\r" "FlexOS\r"

    Note the required carriage return (\\r) at the end of the string.

# Ruby Extensions
\index{Ruby}

It is possible to extend MicroEMACS by writing commands in Ruby.
To add Ruby support, you must specify the `--with-ruby` flag to `configure` when you
build MicroEMACS.  For example:

    mkdir objruby
    cd objruby
    ../configure --with-ruby
    make
    sudo make install # optional step

The resulting MicroEMACS is not linked directly with the Ruby runtime
library.  Instead, it loads the Ruby library dynamically as needed.
This allows you to copy the MicroEMACS executable (`pe`) to a system where Ruby is not
available, and it will still run, but without Ruby support.

A Ruby-enabled MicroEMACS will work only on a system that has the same
version of Ruby as the build system.  You will need to rebuild it for
each system that has a different version of Ruby.

## Initialization

In order for Ruby commands to run correctly, you will need to
copy a helper file called `pe.rb`, located in the `ruby` subdirectory
of the source code, to `/etc`. Running `sudo make install` after
building a Ruby-enabled MicroEMACS will perform the copy.
MicroEMACS will attempt to load the helper file when it starts.
If it cannot load the file, you will not be able to use the Ruby
extensions.

At startup, MicroEMACS will also attempt to load an initialization
script that you have written.  It will first look for a file called `.pe.rb`
(note the leading dot) in your home directory, and load that if found.  If it can't find `.pe.rb`
in your home directory, it will look in your current directory.  This
will allow you to define your own custom commands on a per-user or
per-project basis, as appropriate.  The `ruby` subdirectory
of the source code has examples that you can use or modify.

## An example

Before delving into details about how to write commands in Ruby,
let's look at an example.  Here is a file called `gccerr.rb`
that implements a command to parse gcc compiler errors and go to
the relevant lines of code.  This is essentially a rewrite of
the built-in **gcc-error**\index{gcc-error} command:

    def gccerr(n)
      keepgoing = true
      while keepgoing
        l = $line
        if (l !~ /^In file included/ && l =~ /(.*):(\d+):(\d+): (.*)/)
          file = $1
          lno = $2
          col = $3
          err = $4
          if File.exist? file
            forw_line
            only_window
            split_window
            forw_window
            file_visit file
            goto_line lno.to_i
            forw_char col.to_i - 1
            echo "#{err}"
            return ETRUE
          else
            echo "File #{file} does not exist"
            return EFALSE
          end
        end
        keepgoing = forw_line == ETRUE
      end
      echo "No more gcc errors"
      return EFALSE
    end

    ruby_command "gccerr"
    bind "gccerr", metactrl('e')

Some things to note about this example:

* It defines a new command called **gccerr**.

* Like all MicroEMACS commands written in Ruby, it takes a single parameter,
  which is the optional numeric argument.

* The new command invokes several built-in MicroEMACS functions, passing
  numeric parameters in some cases.

* It invokes built-in MicroEMACS commands, using their names with dashes replaced
  by underscores.  For example, it invokes the `file-visit` command by calling
  the `file_visit` method.

* It uses the global variable `$line` to get the contents of the current line.

* It checks the status of the **forw-line** command by comparing it with
  the constant `ETRUE`, which corresponds to the constant `TRUE` in the
  C source code of MicroEMACS.

* After the definition of the command, there is code to tell MicroEMACS about
  the new command, and to bind it to the `M-C-E` key.

* If you want MicroEMACS to load this script automatically when it starts,
  rename it to `.pe.rb` and copy it either to your current directory or
  your home directory.

## Ruby-related commands

MicroEMACS has several built-in commands related to Ruby extensions:

**F6**

:   **ruby-string**\index{F6}\index{ruby-string}

    This command prompts you to enter a line of Ruby code.
    MicroEMACS then passes the line to the Ruby interpreter.
    One common use of this command is to load a file containing
    Ruby code for a new command.  For example, to load the code for
    the `gccerr` command described above, you could enter this command
    to `ruby-string`:

        load 'PATH/gccerr.rb'

    where you would replace PATH with the actual directory containing
    `gccerr.rb`.

[unbound]

:    **ruby-command**\index{ruby-command}

    This command prompts you to enter the name of a Ruby function
    that implements a new command.  MicroEMACS then enters
    the command into its symbol table but does not bind it to a key;
    you can use the `bind-to-key` command for that.  The `gccerr`
    example above shows a use of this command.

[unbound]

:   **ruby-load**\index{ruby-load}

    This command prompts the user for the name of a Ruby script,
    then loads that script.  This is shortcut that has the same
    effect as using **ruby-string** and a `load` Ruby statement.

## Calling Built-in Commands from Ruby

Ruby code can call built-in MicroEMACS commands (written in C) by
invoking them as normal functions, but with the '-' characters
in the names replaced by '_'.  For example, invoke the **forw-char**
function by calling `forw_char`.

You can pass an optional numeric parameter to a built-function.
For example, to move the dot forward by 8 characters, use this code:

    forw_char 8

Some commands prompt the user for one or more strings.  You can
supply these strings to a command by passing them as parameters.
For example, to replace all occurrences of `Windows` to `Linux`
in the current buffer, use this code:

    replace_string "Windows", "Linux"

Some built-in commands prompt the user for a keystroke.  Two examples
are **help** and **bind-to-key**.  These commands will not work as
expected when invoked from Ruby, because as of this writing there is not
a way to pass keycodes as additional parameters to commands.

Microemacs provides a `bind` helper function to work around
the problem with the **bind-to-key** command.  For example, the `gccerr.rb`
code above used this helper to bind the **gccerr** command to
the **M-C-E** key:

    bind "gccerr", metactrl('e')

Commands return a trinary value indicating success, failure, or abort.
In Ruby, these values are:

`ETRUE`

:   The command succeeded.

`EFALSE`

:   The command failed.  For example, `forw_line` returns `EFALSE`
    if the dot is already at the last line, as we can see in the
    `gccerr` example above.

`EABORT`

:   The command was aborted by Control-G.

The **echo** command is useful when debugging Ruby code.  It displays
a string on the echo line, so you can use it to display debug
messages.  For example, this code displays the current line number:

    echo "line number is #{$lineno}"

## Defining Commands in Ruby

You can create a new command in Ruby by first defining a function
that takes a single numeric parameter.  This parameter gives the
numeric argument that the user typed as a prefix (using **C-U**).  If the
user didn't specify a numeric argument, the parameter will be `nil`.

Then use the **ruby-command** built-in command to inform
MicroEMACS of the new command.

Referring to the `gccerr.rb` example above, we can see that
the code first defines a new command function:

    def gccerr(n)
      .. ruby code ...
    end

Then it tells MicroEMACS about the new command:

    ruby_command "gccerr"

Finally, it binds the new command to the **M-C-E** key:

    bind "gccerr", metactrl('e')

### Helper Functions

MicroEMACS provides several helper functions
for use in Ruby commands.

`insert(string)`

:   This function inserts the value of the `string` parameter into the current
    buffer at the dot. The string may contain newline characters, which are treated as
    line breaks.

`setmode(name)`

:   This function deletes the current buffer's mode, if any.
    It then creates a mode called `name`, with an empty key binding table, and attaches
    it to the buffer.  See the [**Modes**](#modes) section below for
    more information about modes.

`bind(name, key, mode=false)`

:   This function binds the command whose name is the string `name`
    to the keycode `key`.  If the `mode` parameter is present, and is
    `true`, the binding is attached to the current buffer's mode, if any.
    Otherrwise, the binding is made global, i.e., available in
    all buffers. See below for the helper functions
    that provide keycodes.

`reply(string)`

:   This function prompts the user on the echo line with the specified
    string, then reads an input line from the user.  It returns the input
    line without a terminating newline, or nil if the user aborts
    the input using Control-G.

`getkey`

:   This function waits for the user to enter a keystroke, then returns
    a **Key** object describing the keystroke.  See the next section
    for a description of the **Key** object.

`popup(string)`

:   This function creates a pop-up window, with the contents specified
    by the `string` parameter.  The string may contain newline characters.
    This function is useful for displaying error messages in a temporary
    window.

### Keycodes

MicroEMACS also provides several helpers for encoding keycodes.
All built-in commands in MicroEMACS take a keycode parameter, which
contains the key that invoked the command.  You can specify the keycode
by passing it as a parameter when calling the command.
As of this writing, the only command that looks at the keycode is **ins-self**.
Given that fact, the following example inserts an 'x' character in to the current buffer:

    ins_self key('x')

The `bind` helper function, described above, also takes a keycode parameter.

Keycodes can be specified using one of the following helper functions.
These helpers all take a single parameter, which is an ordinary ASCII character.

* `key`: specifies an ordinary, unmodified character.  For example,
  `key('c')` means the character 'c'.

* `ctrl`: specifies a control character.  For example,
  `ctrl('c')` means **C-C** (Control-C).

* `meta`: specifies a meta character. For example,
  `meta('c')` means **M-C** (Escape C or Alt-C).

* `ctlx`: specifies a character with the `C-X` prefix.  For example,
  `ctlx('c')` means **M-X C** (Control-X C).

* `metactrl`: specifies a combination of `meta` and `ctrl`.  For example,
  `metactrl('c')` means **M-C-C** (Escape Control-C).

* `ctlxctrl`: specifies a combination of `ctlx` and `ctrl`.  For example,
  `ctlxctrl('c')` means **C-X C-C** (Control-X Control-C).

These helpers all return an object of the class **Key**.  This object contains the raw keycode
as used internally by MicroEMACS, and provides methods for examining the keycode.
Here are the **Key** methods:

`ctrl?`

:   Returns true if the key is a control key.


`meta?`

:   Returns true if the key is a meta key (i.e., has an Escape prefix).


`ctlx?`

:   Returns true if the key is a Control-X key (i.e., has a Control-X prefix).


`normal?`

:   Returns true if the key is a "normal" key (i.e., is not a control, meta,
    or Control-X key).

`to_i`

:   Returns the key's raw keycode.

`char`

:   Returns the normal character portion of the keycode, without
    any control, meta, or Control-X flags.  As an example, the
    `char` of the Control-G keycode is the character 'G'.

`to_s`

:   Returns a human readable string for the keycode.  As an example,
    the `to_s` of the Control-G keycode is 'C-G'.

### Global variables

MicroEMACS provides several global virtual variables that may be both read
and written in Ruby code.

`$line`

:   This variable contains the current line (the line containing the dot),
    with a newline character appended if this is not the last line in the
    buffer.  Writing to this variable causes the current line to be replaced
    with the specified string.  A newline at the end of the string is removed,
    but newlines at other positions in the string are left unchanged and cause
    line breaks.

`$char`

:   This variable contains the character at the dot.  Writing to this variable
    replaces the character at the dot with the specified string (which can
    be of any length).

`$lineno`

:   This variable contains the line number of the line containing the dot.
    The value is 1-based, for compatibility with the **goto-line** function.
    Writing to this variable causes the dot to be moved to the specified line.

`$offset`

:   This variable contains the offset into the current line of the dot.
    The value is 0-based, so that it can be used as an index into `$line`.
    Writing to this variable moves the dot to the specified offset within
    the current line.

`$filename`

:   This variable contains the current buffer's filename.  Writing to this
    variable changes the current buffer's filename.

`$tabsize`

:   This variable contains the current tab width.  Writing to this variable
    sets the tab width, as in the **set-tab-size** command.

`$fillcol`

:   This variable contains the current fill column for paragraph justification.  Writing to this variable
    sets the fill column, as in the **set-fill-column** command.

`$bflag`

:   This variable contains the current buffer's flags, and can be read or written.
    The flags are an OR of these values: BFCHG (buffer has changed), BFBAK (buffer
    needs a backup), and BFRO (buffer is read-only).  For example, this code:

        $bflag &= ~BFCHG

    turns off the "buffer changed" flag.  This is a dangerous operation, because
    it could result in data loss.

## Exceptions

If an exception occurs in Ruby code, MicroEMACS will open a temporary
window containing the exception information, including a backtrace.

In the unlikely event that the Ruby interpreter crashes with a segfault,
it prints complete exception information to the terminal, but the output is difficult to
read because MicroEMACS puts the terminal into "raw" mode.
If you need to see the exception information, you can restart MicroEMACS
with stderr redirected to a file:

    pe 2>ruby.log

Then, if you can reproduce the crash, the file `ruby.log` will contain
the exception information.

## Aborting Ruby Commands

If your Ruby code is taking too long to run, and you want to stop it,
you will need to send it a signal from another terminal window.  In that
window, find the ID of the process that is running MicroEMACS, using a
command such as this:

    ps -x | grep pe

Then using the process ID that this command displays, kill the Ruby
code using:

    kill -SIGINT <id>

The helper code in `pe.rb` catches this signal and raises an exception that
aborts the errant Ruby code and return control to MicroEMACS.

# Modes

\index{Mode}
If MicroEMACS has been built with Ruby support, it will also support
the notion of modes, which are similar to major modes in Emacs.
A mode consists of a name (which is arbitrary) and a set of key bindings
local to that mode, and is attached to a specific buffer.  By default,
buffers in MicroEMACS do not have modes, but you can provide support
for modes by loading Ruby support for them.  Modes can be used to
implement features for particular types of code, or to provide
special types of buffers that are not treated solely as plain text.

## Mode initialization

When MicroEMACS reads a file into a buffer, or visits a file (which
may or may not exist yet), it calls the Ruby function `initmode`, which
lives in the file `pe.rb`, and which gets loaded whenever MicroEMACS starts.
This function attempts to determine the name of the mode associated
with the file being edited.  First, it examines the first few lines
in the file itself for a line containing a string in the following format:

    -*-MODE-*-

where `MODE` is the name of the mode associated with the file.

If such a string cannot be found, `initmode` then examines the name
of the file itself, and attempts to find a match in the `$modetable`
array in `pe.rb`.  This table associates filename patterns with mode names.
The table has very few entries by default, but you can expand it as necessary by editing `pe.rb` directly,
or by overwriting it or adding to it in your own Ruby extension.

If `initmode` can determine the mode name, it calls the function `MODE_mode`,
where `MODE` is the name of the mode.  For example, if `initmode` determines
that the mode name is `c`, it calls the function `c_mode`, if it exists.
This function is called the mode hook, and it is responsible for performing
all necessary initialization for the mode.  If the mode hook does not exist,
MicroEMACS does not report an error.

## Simple mode example

To see how a rudimentary mode is written, look at the file `mode.rb`
in the MicroEMACS source code.  (This file should also have been installed
in `/usr/local/share/pe`, if you built MicroEMACS and ran `make install`.)

Here is the code for `c_mode`, the hook for C files, mentioned above:

    def c_mode
      setmode "C"
      bind "gnu_indent", ctrl('j'), true
      echo "This is C mode"
    end

The first line in this function creates a new mode for the current buffer,
and assigns it the name "C".  The name is arbitrary, and is used only
for displaying in the mode line for the buffer.  But `setmode` must
be called; otherwise a mode will not exist for the current buffer,
and attempts to mode-local key bindings will not succeed.

The second line in this function binds the MicroEMACS function `gnu-indent`
to the **C-J** key.  This binding is local to this mode only.  If you switch
to a buffer that has a different mode, or no mode, the binding for **C-J** may well be different.

The third line in this function is present only for debugging purposes.
It can be safely deleted.

You can load this rudimentary mode support automatically by adding the following
line to `~/pe.rb` or `./pe.rb`:

    load 'mode.rb'

## A more complicated mode example

The file `dired.rb`, also provided with MicroEMACS, is a more elaborate example of a mode.
It implements a directory browser similar
to the dired mode in Emacs.  Unlike the simple
example shown above, it provides both global and mode-specific key bindings,
and it does not provide a mode hook function.
Instead, it provides a new command, `dired`, that is globally bound
to the keystroke **C-X D**:

    ruby_command "dired"
    bind "dired", ctlx('d')

The file `dired.rb` also creates three new commands but does not bind them to
keystrokes immediately:

    ruby_command "visitfile"
    ruby_command "openfile"
    ruby_command "displayfile"

The initialization of the mode happens in the `dired` function when
you enter the keystroke **C-X D**.  This function prompts you
for a directory name, then calls `showdir` to open a view
on the directory.

The `showdir` function opens a new window with a buffer called `*dired*`,
to avoid conflict with existing buffers.  It clears any existing contents
of the buffer.  It then runs `/bin/ls -laF` to
load the buffer with a directory listing.  The first line in the
buffer contains the directory name, and each subsequent line contains
information about a file in that directory, as provided by `ls`.  If the name of a file ends
in a '/' character, that file is actually a subdirectory.  Finally,
`showdir` marks the buffer as read-only.

The `showdir` function then performs some string matching to determine
that starting column for filenames in the directory listings.
Finally, it creates a mode for the directory listing and attaches
three key bindings to it:

    setmode "dired"
    bind "visitfile", ctrl('m'), true
    bind "openfile", key('o'), true
    bind "displayfile", ctrl('o'), true

The `bind` calls create key bindings for the three new commands
that were defined earlier.  These bindings perform three distinct
actions on the file under the cursor (called the "selected" file):

* The `Enter` key opens the selected file in a new window,
  replacing the current dired window (which still exists).

* The `o` key splits the screen into two windows, one containing
  the dired buffer, and the other containing the selected file.
  It then moves the cursor to the selected file.

* The `C-O` key is similar to the `o` key, except that it does
  not move the cursor to the selected file.

You can load the dired mode support automatically by adding the following
line to `~/pe.rb` or `./pe.rb`:

    load 'dired.rb'

# UTF-8 and Unicode

\index{UTF-8}\index{Unicode}
MicroEMACS supports reading and writing text files
encoded with UTF-8, a byte-oriented encoding of Unicode.  UTF-8 can
be thought of as a superset of ASCII: bytes less then 0x80 are
identical to ASCII, and bytes greater than or equal to 0x80 are always
parts of UTF-8 sequences.  UTF-8 characters vary in length from
one byte (ASCII) to six bytes, though four bytes is the longest
typically seen.

Internally, Microemacs stores lines of text in their original
UTF-8 encoding, but displays multibyte UTF-8 sequences to the user
as single Unicode characters in the range 0x80 to 0xffff.  Unicode
characters greater then 0xffff are not supported; in practice
these characters are extremely rare.

For the most part, MicroEMACS is able to display UTF-8 characters 
correctly, with the exception of non-spacing or combining characters.
The display of these characters is undefined: sometimes they show up
as modifiers of subsequent characters, or as blanks, or as a lowercase
'x' with a modifier.

On Linux, most terminal programs support a standard method for
entering Unicode characters at the keyboard: hold down Ctrl and Shift,
then press and release 'u', then release Ctrl and Shift, then enter
the hex digits of the Unicode character followed by the Enter key.
This method works when entering characters at prompts in the echo line,
or while entering text in the edit buffer.

If this method doesn't work, you can still enter Unicode characters
in the edit buffer using the following command:

**M-C-U**

:   **unicode**\index{M-C-U}\index{unicode (command)}

    This command prompts you to enter a line of text containing the hexadecimal
    values of one or more Unicode characters.  The hex values must
    not have a '0x' prefix, or any other prefix, and must be
    separated by spaces.  MicroEMACS will then insert the corresponding UTF-8
    characters into the current buffer.

    As an example, entering the string `e0 e1 e2` would insert the characters
    `àáâ` into the buffer.

# Building a MicroEMACS

\index{Building a MicroEMACS}
All versions of MicroEMACS are built from the two sets of
source files. One set is independent of operating system and terminal,
and the other set is dependent.

Compile time options for the independent modules
are selected by setting compilation
switches in `def.h`, and then letting conditional compilation do the
right thing.

The dependent modules are briefly described below.

## Operating System

\index{Operating System}
MicroEMACS runs on several operating systems, including Linux\index{Linux},
FreeBSD, and Windows.  Support code for other operating systems has been lost
(in the distant past, these included CP/M-86 and MS-DOS on the DEC Rainbow,
VMS on the VAX, CP/M-68K, GEMDOS, and FlexOS V60/68K/286).
The following modules contain code dependencies on the operating system:

* `ttyio.c` - low level terminal I/O; independent of terminal type.

* `spawn.c` - subjob creation.

* `fileio.c` - low level file handling.

* `bcopy.s` or `bcopy.asm` - fast byte copy and fill functions.

Adding a new operating system consists mostly of changing these
files, and the header file `sysdef.h`.

## Terminal Support

\index{Terminal Support}
MicroEMACS supports several kinds of terminals: those
supporting ncurses or termcap, and the native Windows text console
(the code for real-mode PC displays and OS/2 terminal windows has been lost).
The following modules contain code dependencies on the terminal type:

* `tty.c` - high-level terminal support.

* `ttyio.c` - low-level terminal support.

* `ttykbd.c` - keyboard dependencies and extensions.

Changing terminal type consists mostly of changing these files, and the header file `ttydef.h`
These files are located in separate per-terminal subdirectories of the `tty` directory.

Some terminals have memory mapped displays, or interfaces that
act as such.  These include ncurses and Windows text consoles.
Support for these
displays is enabled by setting the MEMMAP switch in `ttydef.h` to 1.
This eliminates the fancy Gosling screen update code in `display.c`,
and enables writing directly to screen memory (or to a screen buffer
that the terminal interface library later writes to the screen).

To
support a new memory-mapped display, you must provide a `putline` function
for writing lines to the display.  On old DOS-base systems, this code
was written in assembly language, but on modern terminals it is
written in C and placed in `tty.c`.

## Building with GCC

To build MicroEMACs on Linux\index{Linux}, FreeBSD, or Windows using Cygwin
or MinGW, use these commands:

    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure
    make # gmake on FreeBSD

You can supply one or more optional parameters to the `configure` command:

`--with-termcap`

:   Use this option to make MicroEMACS use the **terminfo** / **termcap**\index{terminfo}\index{termcap} libraries for
    screen management, instead of the default **ncursesw**\index{ncursesw}\index{ncurses} library.
    This option will not work on Windows.

`--enable-debug`

:   Use this option to compile and build MicroEMACS with debugging information, so that
    it can be debugged with gdb.

`--with-ruby`

:   Use this option to build support for Ruby extensions into MicroEMACS.
    This option will not work on Windows or FreeBSD.
    See the [**Ruby Extensions**](#ruby-extensions) section above for more information.

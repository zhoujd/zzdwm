This version of MicroEMACS is adapted by me from the version 2 furnished
with the Atari Mark Williams C compiler.

I made it work on:
	- many Unix flavours (BSD, SYSV, Linux, ...)
	- VAX/VMS
	- DOS

To generate, choose and edit one of the makefile.xx or build.ninja.
You may have to edit the file ed.h to adjust some options.
When made, the resulting standalone executable is 'me' or 'me.exe'
and may be copied to any directory of your PATH.

'me' may be called with up to 6 file names as command line arguments.
The file 'me.doc' contains the list of the keybindings, but you should
better have a minimum knowledge of the GNU emacs before using MicroEMACS:
there is no general documentation here!
